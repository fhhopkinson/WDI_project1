HANGMAN.

sHow the game is played.

A two player game as you have played before. Input a start word or words in the box at the top and press enter. This adds Player 1's word to the game. It is then up to Player 2 to then guess the word or words that have been chosen. The winner is determined by Player 1 hanging Player 2 or Player 2 escaping the noose by getting the word right.

How it works.

The game starts by entering the start word. This presents below the central graphic on input. This also hides the top of the start screen to fit the whole game on the page. As Player 2 chooses his letters he clicks on the button with the letter that he has chosen. If correct the letter will fill the correct space that has been created. Once the letter has been clicked then it will change colour to denote that it has already been chosen as if selected twice Player 2's live will continue to be lost. Those lives tick down with every incorrect letter.

How it was designed.

Some of the logic influence the design due to the way it manifested in the browser with the simple JS, CSS and HTML that I knew. The CSS was re-using a colour scheme and format of a previous project because I thought that it looked great and so I implemented it. Symmetry and simplicity I find seem to make things look better than they are so I used these principals in the design. Some of the things on the bucket list I would have been capable of doing easily but I think that they effected the playability and begin to make the page too busy.

What I learned.

As this was my first programming project, the main focus should have been cramming different bits of logic in to put pressure on my knowledge of different facets of logic and design but I have learnt a lot from the little that I have done.I'm pleased with the work I have done, and now feel much more comfortable with javascript and jQuery. My CSS skills also improved.
