Intital stuff to get to grips with:


when the correct letter is selected from the buttons displaying the letters on the on click if the letter matches any in the array the letter is revealed. If the letter is not in the arr then the tile is hidden.(the amount of letters can be recorded for the hanging feature.) on click hide every tile of the alphabet.

win logic is created by both arrays matching each other and then  saying that player two wins. Player one wins when all the letters of the alphabet are exhausted.

CSS will require 26 tiles at least.  Score counter? pop up startWord. anitmation of the hanging in 7 moves.


considerations: $("#score1").text(player1Score)
                $("#score2").text(Player2Score)*/
